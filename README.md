🌍 WanderWise - Smart Travel Companion

A React-based travel application designed to bridge the gap between itinerary planning and on-the-ground logistics.




📖 Project Overview

Most travel apps focus solely on booking flights and hotels. WanderWise solves the "last mile" problem of travel by integrating soft skills (cultural etiquette, local laws) with hard logistics (transport simulation, budget planning).

This project demonstrates the ability to build complex, interactive interfaces using React without relying on heavy external frameworks, focusing on pure component architecture and state management.

✨ Key Features

1. 🚕 Simulated Cab Booking Portal

Technical Challenge: Mimicking real-world API latency and asynchronous state.

Implementation: Built a booking flow that handles loading, confirmed, and error states to provide immediate user feedback during the "transaction."

2. 🗺️ Integrated Discovery System

Stay & Shop: Dynamic rendering of hotels and markets based on the selected destination.

Hyper-Local Data: Curated lists of "Must-Try" foods and specific safety tips (e.g., "Is tap water safe?").

3. ⚖️ Cultural Intelligence Engine

Laws vs. Etiquette: A unique data structure that separates legal requirements (strict) from social norms (polite), helping travelers avoid fines and faux pas.

4. 📅 Smart Itinerary & Budgeting

Timeline View: A day-by-day breakdown of activities.

Budget Estimator: Real-currency breakdowns for different traveler levels (Budget vs. Luxury).

🛠️ Tech Stack

Frontend: React.js (Component-based architecture)

Styling: Tailwind CSS (Utility-first styling for responsiveness)

Icons: Lucide React (Visual consistency)

State Management: React useState & useEffect
